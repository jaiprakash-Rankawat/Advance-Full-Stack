# What are Events in React.js

- Events are actions that occur in a user interface, such as a button click or form submission.
- onClick : vist to `OnClick.jsx` file and see the code.
- onMouseMove : vist to `OnMouseMove.jsx` file and see the code.
- onCopy : vist to `OnCopy.jsx` file and see the code.

# State & Hooks Introduction

- React uses state to manage data that changes over time.
- Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components.

### Common React Hooks

- useState → Manages state in functional components.
- useEffect → Handles side effects (e.g., API calls, event listeners).
- useContext → Provides a way to pass data deeply without prop drilling.
- useRef → Provides a reference to DOM elements or mutable values.
- useReducer → Alternative to useState, useful for complex state logic.

# State in Action

- 1. Basic Calculator : vist to `BasicCalculator.jsx` file and see the code.
- 2. Array Update : vist to `ArrayUpdate.jsx` file and see the code.
- 3. Object Update : vist to `ObjectUpdate.jsx` file and see the code.
- 4. Sharing State : vist to `BasicCalculator.jsx` file and `SharingState.jsx` file then see the code.

# Passing Function to useState

- 1. Example1 : vist to `Example1.jsx` file and see the code.
- 2. Example2 : vist to `Example2.jsx` file and see the code.
