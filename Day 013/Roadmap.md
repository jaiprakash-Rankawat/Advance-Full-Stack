# 1️⃣ Custom Hooks Introduction

- custom Hooks are javascript functions that start with the prefix `use` (eg: useFetch, useForm) and can call other hooks within them. They allow you to extract and reuse logic that involves state or side effects, making your components more reusable and maintainable.

# 2️⃣ Custom Hooks in Action

- Read `UseFetch.jsx` and `App.jsx` files.
- custom hook does not return jsx.
