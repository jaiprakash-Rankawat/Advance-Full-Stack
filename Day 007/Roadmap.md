# What is React Portal

- React Portals allow you to render children outside of the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.
- Portals are useful when you want to render content that is not part of the normal DOM hierarchy, such as modals, tooltips, or notifications.

- ### Steps :

  - creat a new id in `index.html` file
  - creat Portal from `react-dom`
  - write some code to it
  - use `document.querySelector()` to display the content
  - render component in `App` component

- see the code in `ReactPortal.jsx` file

# React Portal in Action

- first see the code in `copyContent.jsx` file (without portal)
- then vist to `copy.jsx` , `portal.jsx` then see code (with portal)
